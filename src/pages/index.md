    I love being a human punching bag - both physically and metaphorically. My favourite hobbies include cow-tipping and brick dusting. I shouldn't be training because I have the physical acuity of a 2 year toddler. Sometimes, I use mismatched socks. Come at me, bro.

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
