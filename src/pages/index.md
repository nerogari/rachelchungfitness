  title: Why Redefine Fitness?
  description: >
    Redefining fitness is about a lifestyle choice, it is about choosing
    methodologies that best suit your needs as a human being. There is no
    template on the perfect lifestyle or what makes any individual person happy.
    It is about redefining your life and how you want to live it through a
    healthy lifestyle of your own choosing. Workouts are what you make of it and
    how you take your progressions to become a better version of yourself.
    Defining what workouts you choose to do, defining what foods you decide to
    put into your body and defining your personal life and what you choose to
    continue to do each day.

        performance in sport and tasks of daily living
