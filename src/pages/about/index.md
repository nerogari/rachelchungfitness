### Personal Training and Fitness  
I love being a human punching bag - both physically and metaphorically. My favourite hobbies include cow-tipping and brick dusting. I shouldn't be training because I have the physical acuity of a 2 year toddler. Sometimes, I use mismatched socks. Come at me, bro.

### Qualifications and Certifications
Qualified monkey wrench user.
