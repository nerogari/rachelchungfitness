My fitness journey began when I was 16 years old, I had suffered a couple of sports injuries that kept me from playing on high school sports teams. Frustrated that I was unable to play, I began taking an interest in exercise where I used the workouts as an escape to clear my mind and stay in shape. I found it helped so much that I started to treat exercise as a form of therapy! Whether I was upset, angry, happy, or excited, I used the gym as a way to help focus my energy in a positive way. Years later I decided to attend post-secondary school to become a personal trainer. I began to come to realized that fitness is more than just fitting into your favorite pair of jeans or reaching a certain weight class. It was about how you felt about yourself after and how exercise positively contributed to your overall mental health. It was about taking care of yourself and giving yourself confidence to achieve your goals. That’s when I had a moment of thought, “How do we define what fitness is? “What is defined as fit”, “Can fitness be defined as super skinny, or tight abs?”
